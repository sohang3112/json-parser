# json-parser

This is a basic JSON parsing library in Haskell. 
I just made it for fun - don't use it for actual development - use [Aeson](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/aeson) instead.

**Note:** Availability of [Haskell Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) is assumed. 
Please download it first, if you don't have it already.

### Features

```json-parser.hs``` exports a ```Json``` data type for representing JSON values, as well as ```parseJson``` and ```showJson```
functions (the function names are self explanatory!)
